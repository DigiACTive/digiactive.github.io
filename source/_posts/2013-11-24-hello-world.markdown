Greetings, Internet!

We're DigiACTive, a team of students from the [Australian National University](http://anu.edu.au) competing in the inaugural [Digital Canberra Challenge](http://digitalcanberrachallenge.com.au).

We're working with the [ACT Territory and Municipal Services Directorate](http://tams.act.gov.au) and [National ICT Australia](http://nicta.com.au) to improve the system of obtaining government permits and approvals to hold public events. At the moment, permit applications are long and complex, and it's easy to accidentally forget to submit important documents -- making the process difficult and frustrating for event organisers. On the other side, the government's legacy systems make it hard to track the progress of applications, making the approval process slower than it ought to be. Overall, it's all a bit of a mess!

That's where we come in. Over the next few months, we'll be developing a proof-of-concept system to help both event organisers and government officials keep track of complex applications while making sure they're complying with all the appropriate regulations. Our prototype will help guide the ACT Government as it adopts new technology to replace the existing permits system.

It's early stages at the moment -- we'll try to keep this blog updated as we go so you can have some idea what we're up to. In the meantime, if you've got some ideas on how to improve the permits system, we'd love to hear from you!
