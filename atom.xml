    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At DigiACTive, we&rsquo;re building our solution on top of an open source software stack. Practically, we had a number of reasons for chosing open source, including price, ease of access and cross-platform compatibility. More fundamentally, open source software has played a huge role in bringing technological innovations to those who would otherwise not have had access to them, and that&rsquo;s very much in line with how we see the Digital Canberra Challenge.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s therefore very exciting to be part of advancing the state of open source software in a couple of small ways.</p>

<h2>Improving django-storage-swift</h2>

<p>We recently submitted a set of patches to <a href="https://github.com/wecreatepixels/django-storage-swift">django-storage-swift</a>, a Python module for interfacing between <a href="http://django.org/">Django</a>, our web framework of choice, and <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/">OpenStack Swift</a>, our object store of choice.</p>

<p>Our main contribution is support for temporary URLs. Temporary URLs provide a way for us to grant users access to their files and their files only in a simple and transparent way. In particular, they are an excellent and simple mechanism for preventing attackers from accessing confidential information by guessing file names. We also improved the out-of-the-box experience for users of django-storage-swift, and made a couple of other minor fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve made our changes available in <a href="https://github.com/DigiACTive/django-storage-swift/tree/digiactive">our fork of the project</a>, and contributed them back to the original project with pull requests.</p>

<h2>Updating the clamav chef cookbook</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re using <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html">chef-solo</a> with <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to deploy repeatable environments for development. We recently tried to install <a href="https://github.com/RoboticCheese/clamav">a cookbook</a> to support <a href="http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/">clamav</a> so we can virus scan user-submitted files, but discovered that it&rsquo;s not compatible with the most recent updates to the <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/yum#notes">yum cookbook</a>. We&rsquo;ve updated it and submitted the changes back to the original author, and they&rsquo;ve been well received and merged in.</p>

<h2>Looking forward</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been making good progress building our framework and we&rsquo;re looking forward to making increasingly rapid progress towards the Digital Canberra Challenge project!</p>

    <id>http://DigiACTive.github.io/blog/2013/11/24/hello-world</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, Internet!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re DigiACTive, a team of students from the <a href="http://anu.edu.au">Australian National University</a> competing in the inaugural <a href="http://digitalcanberrachallenge.com.au">Digital Canberra Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re working with the <a href="http://tams.act.gov.au">ACT Territory and Municipal Services Directorate</a> and <a href="http://nicta.com.au">National ICT Australia</a> to improve the system of obtaining government permits and approvals to hold public events. At the moment, permit applications are long and complex, and it&rsquo;s easy to accidentally forget to submit important documents &mdash; making the process difficult and frustrating for event organisers. On the other side, the government&rsquo;s legacy systems make it hard to track the progress of applications, making the approval process slower than it ought to be. Overall, it&rsquo;s all a bit of a mess!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where we come in. Over the next few months, we&rsquo;ll be developing a proof-of-concept system to help both event organisers and government officials keep track of complex applications while making sure they&rsquo;re complying with all the appropriate regulations. Our prototype will help guide the ACT Government as it adopts new technology to replace the existing permits system.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s early stages at the moment &mdash; we&rsquo;ll try to keep this blog updated as we go so you can have some idea what we&rsquo;re up to. In the meantime, if you&rsquo;ve got some ideas on how to improve the permits system, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you! Contact us at <a href="mailto:digiactive.canberra%20at%20gmail%20dot%20com">digiactive.canberra at gmail dot com</a>.</p>
